Patentability shall not be negated by the manner in which the invention was made.\n\n\nClaims 1-10, 12-14 and 15-18 are rejected under 35 U.S.C. 103 as being unpatentable over Monroe (US 2005/0255810 A1) in view of Mei (US 2014/0253246 A1).\nConsider claim 1:\nMonroe discloses a radio front-end (see Fig. 2 and paragraph 0032, where Monroe describes a radio frequency (RF) transceiver 250 that is connected to a transmit-receive (T/R) switch 255), comprising:\na transmit path comprising a power amplifier (see Fig. 3 and paragraph 0035, where Monroe describes that the transmit path of the RF transceiver 250 comprises a power amplifier 302);\na receive path comprising a low-noise amplifier (see Fig. 3 and paragraph 0035, where Monroe describes that the receive path of the RF transceiver 250 comprises a low-noise amplifier 303);

Monroe discloses the transmit/receive switch connects the transmit path to the antenna by a minimal-length path having a length determined by a minimum feature pitch (see Fig. 3 and paragraph 0039, where Monroe describes the transmit path 399 in which the transmit signal enters circulator 310 on the way to antenna 260).\nConsider claims 5, 14 and 18:\nMonroe in view of Mei discloses the invention of claims 1, 8 and 15 above. Monroe discloses a second switched reactive impedance connected in parallel with the low-noise amplifier, said second switched reactive impedance having an impedance configured to neutralize a reactive input impedance of the low-noise amplifier (see Fig. 1A and paragraph 0005, where Monroe describes that during receive periods, a quarter-wave transmission line 155 and the pin-diode 160 in parallel with the LNA input impedance present a 50 ohm impedance).\nConsider claim 6:\nMonroe in view of Mei discloses the invention of claim 1 above. Monroe discloses a one-quarter wavelength transmission line connecting the low-noise amplifier to the antenna (see Fig. 6 and paragraph 0042, where Monroe describes a quarter-wave transmission line 605 connecting the low-noise amplifier 303 to the antenna 260).\nConsider claim 7:\nMonroe in view of Mei discloses the invention of claim 6 above. Monroe discloses a switch connected to ground in parallel with the low-noise amplifier that is closed during transmission (see Fig. 3 and paragraph 0037, where Monroe describes a pin diode 335 that is connected to ground, which is on and appears as a short circuit during transmit mode).\nConsider claims 10 and 17:\nMonroe in view of Mei discloses the invention of claims 9 and 16 above. Monroe does not specifically disclose connecting a set of the independently switched impedances selected to most closely match the reactive impedance of the power amplifier. \nMei teaches connecting a set of independently switched impedances selected to most closely match the reactive impedance of the power amplifier (see Fig. 1 and paragraphs 0005-0006, where Mei describes that the inverting impedance matching network matches the output impedance of the power amplifier Z1 to an impedance Z2). \nTherefore, it would have been obvious to one ordinary skill in the art before the effective filing date of the claimed invention to include connecting a set of the independently switched impedances selected to most closely match the reactive impedance of the power amplifier, as taught by Mei to modify the method of Monroe in order to improve efficiency, as discussed by Mei (see paragraphs 0004-0005).\nConsider claim 12:\nMonroe in view of Mei discloses the invention of claim 8 above.

Monroe discloses setting the receive path to a low impedance during reception by disconnecting the ground at the point between the low- noise amplifier and the one-quarter wavelength transmission line (see Fig. 5 and paragraph 0041, where Monroe describes the receive mode).\n\nClaim 11 is rejected under 35 U.S.C. 103 as being unpatentable over Monroe (US 2005/0255810 A1) in view of Mei (US 2014/0253246 A1), as applied to claim 10 above, and further in view of Gorbachov (US 2012/0280754 A1).\nConsider claim 11:\nMonroe in view of Mei discloses the invention of claim 10 above. Monroe does not specifically disclose measuring the reactive impedance of the power amplifier.\nBank teaches measuring the reactive impedance of the power amplifier (see claim 7, where Gorbachov describes the reactive impedance of a power amplifier is approximately 0 Ohms).\nTherefore, it would have been obvious to one ordinary skill in the art before the effective filing date of the claimed invention to include measuring the reactive impedance of the power amplifier, as taught by Gorbachov to modify the method of Monroe in order to improve primary performance parameters, as discussed by Gorbachov (see paragraph 0070).\n\nConclusion\n",

Allowable Subject Matter  12-151-07 AIA 07-97 12-51-07 Claim s 1-18 are allowed.  13-03 AIA The following is an examiner\u2019s statement of reasons for allowance:  The independent claims (claims 1, 8 and 15) of the instant application have been amended to recite an invention of configuring a first reactive impedance in parallel with a power amplifier on a transmit path. The first reactive impedance has an impedance that is opposite to a reactive impedance of the power amplifier.  The prior art of record fails to anticipate or render obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art all the claim elements of the claims 1, 8 and 15.

Therefore, claims 1, 8 and 15 are considered distinct from prior art and are allowable. Since claims 2-7 are depending on claim 1, claims 9-14 are depending on claim 8, and claims 16-18 are depending on claim 15, the dependent claims become allowable accordingly .
